## About Me

I am a software developer with a love for solving complex problems through code. On my profile, you'll find a collection of my personal projects and contributions to open source software.

Throughout my 3 Years in the industry as a freelancer, I have had the opportunity to work with a variety of programming languages and frameworks. My experience has ranged from building android and IOS applications to developing web-based solutions, and everything in between.

One of my favorite things about being a software developer is the constant learning and growth that comes with it. I am always striving to improve my skills and stay up-to-date with the latest technologies. On my GitHub profile, you'll see a reflection of that dedication as I share my projects and contributions with the community.

Thank you for stopping by and I hope you find something here that interests you. Feel free to reach out and connect with me - I'm always open to discussing new ideas and opportunities.
